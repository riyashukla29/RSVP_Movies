# RSVP_Movies

## Project Overview
RSVP Movies, a prominent Indian film production company, is expanding its horizons to release a movie targeted at a global audience in 2022. Traditionally focused on the Indian market, the company is now looking to make data-driven decisions for this ambitious project. This repository contains the SQL analysis performed on the past three years of movie data to derive insights that will guide RSVP Movies in their strategic planning.

## Problem Statement
RSVP Movies has produced numerous super-hit films in India and is now venturing into the global market. The company aims to leverage data analytics to ensure the success of this global release. As part of this project, I have been provided with a dataset containing information about movies released over the past three years. My task is to analyze this data using SQL to extract meaningful insights and provide actionable recommendations that will aid RSVP Movies in their decision-making process.
